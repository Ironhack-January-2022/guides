#### TLDR;

* Navigate to your GitHub Repository of the project that you want to deploy

* Click on Settings at the top

* Under "GitHub Pages", use the None or Branch drop-down menu and select master as a publishing source.

* Click the save button

* You should see the URL where the app can be accessed

* You only need to do this once - whenever you push now to master the app is automatically updated
