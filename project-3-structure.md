### First use Ironlauncher to start the project and create the backend - we will use the json flag to create a json api template.

### In this example our project will be called 'projector'

```bash
$ npx ironlauncher@latest projector --json
```

### Now we will go into the root project folder and create a react app there - this will be in a folder called 'client'
```bash
$ cd projector
$ npx create-react-app client
```

### This should result in exactly the same structure that we have [in this example](https://github.com/Ironhack-WDFT-August-2021/w8d1/tree/master/project-management-app)

### Then we also want to remove git from within the client folder - otherwise you will get an error later if you use git in your project

```bash
# in: projector/client
$ rm -rf .git
```

### Make sure in the .gitignore file in the root of your project you now also list the node_modules from the client folder

```
/client/node_modules
```

### Then we want to add git to the root folder of our project

```bash
$ git init
```

### And then make the first commit

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
```

### Then you go to GitHub, create a new repository for your project, copy the line 'git remote add origin ...' and push to master

Now we have our basic project structure ðŸ’ª 

The other team members can now clone the repo from GitHub (make sure to run npm install in both the root and in the client folder).

Happy hacking ðŸ’™
