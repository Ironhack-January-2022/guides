# Technical Interviews

### General Preparation

* Do a lot of Katas (also easy ones to get used to the feeling of being able to solve the problem easily)

* While doing them proceed as we trained, divide the problem into small steps, if you have problems doing that think about how you would solve the problem yourself (if the array would be a long list on a piece of paper etc.)

* Read up all the theoretical stuff again (How the Internet works etc.) - they could ask about it, it will not be the most important thing but it is good to have a basic understanding of the internet.


### Interview Questions (if you wanna practice some more)

### During the interview

* Keep calm, even if you cannot solve the problem completely
* Verbalize your thought process
* First describe the problem (to the point, in one or two sentences)
* Then talk about your solution and the necessary steps - think out loud!

### After the Interview

* If the company rejects you it could be you have to get better but what could also be is that they were not really looking for a junior developer but for someone with some years of experience - that is not your fault

* Try not to loose your confidence !!! - best way not to loose it is to keep coding

### Coding Challenges

#### After the technical interview you typically get a coding challenge - this could be something like the ironcontacts lab

#### Everything that is in the code you should be able to explain how it works

#### Keep an eye on: 

* Clean formatting
* Nice readme, info about installation / running the app, maybe explaining architeture choices  
* No console.log()s or unnecessary comments
* Good naming of functions and variables - really think twice about all the naming decisions
* Readability
